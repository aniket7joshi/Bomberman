This is the basic Bomberman game I have made for my Assignment as part of my 3rd Semester course SSAD.

To start the game type "python main.py" on your terminal.

Basic Controls:
Move left - a
Move right - d
Move up - w
Move down - s
Drop bomb - b

If you move Bomberman at a constant speed then the enemy continues its normal speed.

As you stops the Bomberman the enemies slows down on its own.

If you destroy a brick 20 points will be added to your score.

If you destroy an enemy 100 points will be added.

As soon as you touch an enemy game will stop and your final score will be printed.

If you want to increase the complexity of your game you can simply go to main.py and increase the number of enemies and bricks as i have mentioned in the comments.

You will get only 1 life to play the game.

You can press q at any point of the game to stop the game.


ENJOY THE GAME!!
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
